## Creating a `Descriptor`

Before we can spawn any jobs one needs to first create a description
of the type of `Job` that will be spawned.


## Adding to your project

The tasky library is [available on DUB](https://code.dlang.org/packages/tasky) and can easily
be added to your project ny running the following command:

```bash
dub add tasky
```
